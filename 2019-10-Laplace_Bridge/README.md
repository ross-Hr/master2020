This is the provisionary git repo for the 'Fast Predictive Uncertainty for Classification with Bayesian Deep Networks' paper. 
The code will definitely be refactored as soon as possible. Until then, however, you can find the basis for all experiments in the exp folder with the files named according to their respective experiments. 

If you have any questions or suggestions do not hesitate to send me a mail at marius.hobbhahn@gmail.com
