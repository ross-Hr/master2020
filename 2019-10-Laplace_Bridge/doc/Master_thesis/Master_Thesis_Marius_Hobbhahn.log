Class scrbook Warning: You've used obsolete option `cleardoubleempty'.
(scrbook)              Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrbook)              and changes compatibility level using
(scrbook)              `cleardoublepage=empty,version=first,
(scrbook)              enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrbook)              in further warnings.
(scrbook)              If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrbook)              replace option `cleardoubleempty' by `cleardoublepage=em
pty'.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrbook)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrbook)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrbook)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrbook)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrbook)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrbook)              is not recommended.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated old font command `\bf' used.

(scrbook)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrbook)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrbook)              defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for
(scrbook)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrbook)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrbook)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrbook)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrbook)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrbook)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in

(scrbook)              command `\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
(scrbook)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the

Class scrbook Warning: \float@addtolists detected!
(scrbook)              Implementation of \float@addtolist became
(scrbook)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrbook)              has been replaced by several more flexible
(scrbook)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrbook)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrbook)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrbook)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrbook)              features and been removed from others.
(scrbook)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrbook)              avoid this warning, if you are using a
(scrbook)              a package that still implements the
(scrbook)              deprecated \float@addtolist interface .

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated old font command `\it' used.
(scrbook)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrbook)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrbook)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrbook)              defined the old font commands like `\it' only for
(scrbook)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrbook)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrbook)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrbook)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrbook)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will

(scrbook)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrbook)              command `\it', e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape '.
(scrbook)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrbook)              package. If you have used the old font command

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated old font command `\it' used.
(scrbook)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrbook)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrbook)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrbook)              defined the old font commands like `\it' only for
(scrbook)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrbook)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrbook)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrbook)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrbook)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrbook)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrbook)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrbook)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrbook)              command `\it', e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape '.
(scrbook)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrbook)              package. If you have used the old font command
(scrbook)              `\it' yourself you should replace it, e.g., by
(scrbook)              `\normalfont \itshape ' on input line 254.
